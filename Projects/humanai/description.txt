ABOUT humanai:
Project 'humanai' is a simple use of the decision-tree algorithm.

EXAMPLE:
Suppose John has python3 installed, and starts the program up.
John launches the file 'learn.py', and is asked about some inputs, regarding a person's characteristics.
John thinks about the people he knows, and with one person in mind at a time, he responds.

Now, after repititive data-feeding, John wonders if he can trust his new friend.
John opens up his machine, and this time, opens 'predict.py'.
He tries his best to rate his friend's characteristics.
Upon entering the last characteristic, John gets what his machine thinks about this new guy
(based on what it was made to think about all those previous guys).
